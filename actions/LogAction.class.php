     * In a typical database-driven application, execute() handles application
     * logic itself and then proceeds to create a model instance. Once the model
     * instance is initialized it handles all business logic for the action.
     *
     * A model should represent an entity in your application. This could be a
     * user account, a shopping cart, or even a something as simple as a
     * single product.
